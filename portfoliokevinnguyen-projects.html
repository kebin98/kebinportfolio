						<h1 class="wtitle">Thunderbolt Inferno - Fighting Game</h1>
						<p class="wsub">I've dreamed of making fighting games ever since I was a young child - and started my first attempts at the endeavour when I was 11 years old.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">Constantly I would be curious in programming, drawing and animating my characters with unique setpieces and movesets.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">Over the years I focused less on a high quantity of characters and more on mechanical depth, to make sure the gameplay felt fluid and responsive.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">This fighting game was my first proper Game Maker Studio 2 project - as a way for me to understand coding in the language.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">It was developed betwen April 13th and July 21st before I decided to stop working on the project.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">The most significant aspect of the coding that helped me program characters faster was building a state system that allowed the backbone of most character techniques to share the same code.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">Animating the characters was an incredibly extensive endavour - one that would mean continuing the game would only be feasible if more animators were on board with this type of project.</p>

						<h1 class="wtitle">Thunderbolt Engine</h1>
						<p class="wsub">I had a very huge scope for a massive adventure game during November.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">Due to this I started to experiment with a map - generation system where you could develop platforming maps using an editor which can be stored in a text file.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">This is how the development for the Thunderbolt Engine began.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">With this project I hope to make an intuitive game editor that will allow for editing game maps, with a unique enemy editor that will allow for making your own unique enemy AI.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">Currently the engine itself is in its infancy and a lot of my resources are going towards making a video game project with various different gameplay styles.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">I created a lot of algorithms to allow for the Thunderbolt Engine to work the way it does, and I plan to program more in the future.</p>

						<h1 class="wtitle">Engine Features</h1>
						<p class="wsub">- The Thunderbolt Engine currently uses various grid systems to store different properties for the maps that are created.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">- A generator mode was created so that aspects of the map's terrain such as the floor depth and slopes - are generated automatically based on its relative positioning compared to other blocks of its kind on the grid.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">- Loading and saving was made with its own UI - maps are stored within various text files, allowing for relatively fast grid loading.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">- An RGB colour picker was made by hard-coding some number conversion, to allow denary values to be converted to binary and hexadecimal.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">- A layer system was created to allow for parallax scrolling between cosmetic maps.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">- Filling in gaps on the map was made possible - special thanks to Smogzone for the inspiration of this tool..</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">- To reduce lag on loading huge maps, a window generating system was implemented - where parts of the map would generate based on its relative positioning around a central point, a "window" per se.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">No current demo exists for the Thunderbolt Engine however it is still being worked on gradually.</p>

						<h1 class="wtitle">Animated Works</h1>
						<p class="wsub">I've spent many years working on my animation ability.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">Currently I use my animation skills to supplement my pixel art that complements my game projects.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">Past animated works I worked on would be in a more traditional style - where I planned and animated some supplementary material for an animated series I wanted to work on.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">My experience animating has helped me understand the scope of animating with moving camera angles and with fluid object physics - to make the visuals pop more.</p>

						<p class="wsub">Since 2021 I've taken my attempt at composing VGM.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">Currently I use soundfonts - which are a library of video game instrument samples.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">For my future projects, I hope to work with my colleagues and also use my own compositions.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">I'm currently inspired by indie rock and the Touhou video game series.</p>

						<h1 class="wtitle">ReactJS projects</h1>
						<p class="wsub">1."Skills App"</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">I was part of Group 41 for the Software Engineering Project module in my Computer Science course.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">For this project I took the lead programmer role to create a skills app program..</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">Admittedly, due to time constraints, the app itself isn't the strongest but showcased my abillity to learn ReactJS very quickly.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">The app is available to view on request.</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">2."Weather App"</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">I was part of Group 19 for the GUI module in my Computer Science course.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">I was also lead programmer in this project, due to confusions on which language to use, before finally settlin with ReactJS..</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">This project was my first attempt at using ReactJS, which I had learned to utilize in approximately 3 days.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="wsub">The app is available to view on request.</p>
